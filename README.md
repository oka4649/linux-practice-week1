# Linux Practice Week 1

This repository contains my first Linux practice exercises.

## Files

- `memo.txt` – Simple text file created and edited from the terminal using `nano`, `cat`, and `grep`.
- `script.sh` – A basic shell script that prints a message. I made it executable with `chmod +x` and ran it with `./script.sh`.

## What I practiced

- Navigating directories (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`)
- Creating and removing files and folders (`mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`)
- Editing files with `nano`
- Checking network and connections (`ping`, `ifconfig`, `lsof`, `curl`)
- Using Git and GitHub (`git init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`)
